## Cheat Sheets

There are many useful cheatsheets that will aggregate commonly used functions and commands into one location. [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/category/python) hosts many of these cheatsheets for Python as well as other languages and programs. The cheatsheet itself is typically a 1-2 page PDF that can be easily referenced for standard functions. Some of the cheatsheets that reference materials in this course include:

1. [Getting started with Python](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/getting-started-with-python-cheat-sheet)
2. [Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/python-for-data-science-cheat-sheet-for-beginners)
3. [Pandas: Data Wrangling](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/pandas-cheat-sheet-data-wrangling-in-python)
4. [Matplotlib](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/matplotlib-cheat-sheet-plotting-in-python)
