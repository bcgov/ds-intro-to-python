These include:\n\nFrom the command line\nInside a jupyter notebook\nFrom a file (inside VSCode)\n\nIn this next section, we are going to have a brief introduction to all of these methods of interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Using the command line\n\n\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that the methods that we will focus on in this course will rely on using VSCode and all of its inner workings. However, if you are comfortable with the command line, we can also access any of these methods directly from there as well, you just need to be able to move to directories before typing commands. If you use the command line, I recommend using an anaconda powershell prompt, as this allows for the easiest use and access to conda commands and only the smallest of headaches.\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Step 0\nIn all cases, we will want to have a folder from which we wish to work out of. Take some time to set up a folder somewhere you won’t lose it. For me, I’ve simply made a folder called Intro to Python on my C: drive that will hold any course materials we use/create here.\nNext, to make any interactions with python, we will want to open VSCode and work from here. When we first open VSCode, you should be prompted to open a folder. We are going to work out of that Intro to Python folder, so open it here. After doing this, we should now have a VSCode screen open that will look something like this:\n\n\n\nVS Code\n\n\n\nWe have 3 main areas that we can utilize:\n\nTo the left (area A): is the current folder and subfolder directory list. We can make new files directly from here.\nTo the right (area B): this is where files we are working on will live. For some file types, preview windows will be available as well.\nTo the bottom (area C): this is where we can open and run commands from the command line (or terminal).\n\nNow remember, we set up a special environment that contains python and our data science packages. We want to make sure we are always using this environment, so in the open terminal, re-type conda activate ds-env and this terminal will now be open in this environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Conda Environments\n\n\n\nAlthough it does add an extra level of set-up whenever we start a python project, having these conda environments ends up being incredibly important for not only reproducibility, but making sure that packages work well together. When in doubt as to if you are using the correct environment, double check that the terminal you are using has (ds-env) in brackets at the start of a line. When building python files directly in VSCode, there is another step we can take to make sure that the correct environment is being used, but we will get to that later…\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 From the command line/terminal\nLet’s start with an easy one. To start a python session from a terminal, simply type python at the command line, and the terminal will automatically open a python interface. You will know you are inside the python interface if your command lines now start with >>>. Now, let’s do the classic Hello World command for python:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n\nHello World!\n\n\nTo exit the python interface and return to the regular terminal, you can type exit() and return to the terminal.\n\n\n1.3.3 From a file (in VSCode)\n\nrun entire file, run single lines\n\nNext up, let’s run an entire python file to tell us hello.\n\n\n1.3.4 From a notebook\n\nhow to open, show you can run the notebooks in vscode too\ndo last and explain that we will be using notebooks throughout the course for the most part"

We again access the command pallette with Ctrl + Shift + P, and begin typing Python: Select Interpreter. Click on this, and choose the ds-env option. We are good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Environments\n\n\n\nAlthough it does add an extra level of set-up whenever we start a python project, having these conda environments ends up being incredibly important for not only reproducibility, but making sure that packages work well together.

When building python files directly in VSCode, there is another step we can take to make sure that the correct environment is being used, but we will get to that later…\n\n\n\n\nFrom the command line/terminal\nLet’s start with an easy one. To start a python session from a terminal, simply type python at the command line, and the terminal will automatically open a python interface. You will know you are inside the python interface if your command lines now start with >>>. Now, let’s do the classic Hello World command for python:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n\nHello World!\n\n\nTo exit the python interface and return to the regular terminal, you can type exit() and return to the terminal.\n\n\nFrom a file (in VSCode)\n\nrun entire file, run single lines\n\nNext up, let’s run an entire python file to tell us hello. Inside our directory, create a new file called hello_world.py. Inside this file, let’s have two lines of code:\n\n\nhello_world.py\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nprint(\"Otters are the best animal.\")\n\nTo run this code, first save the file, and then simply click the play button (triangle in the top right!). Note that this will display an output in a terminal at the bottom of VSCode. VSCode takes the python file you told it to run, and will run every line of code individually. Thus, we get two lines of output for the two print statements.\nBut wait, there’s more! In VSCode we can run individual lines of code within a file as well. Simply move your cursor to the line you wish to run, and hit Shift+Enter.\nNote the difference here. Instead of running the entire file, VSCode actually opened up a python window inside our terminal, and ran the single line of code, just like we did before.\n\nChallenge 1\n\nRun the other line of code, and then add and run third line of code that prints your favourite TV show.\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 1\n\n hit Shift+Enter while the cursor is on the other line of code. Add a line of code such as:\nprint(\"C'mon son! You know the best show is Psych!\")\nSave the file, and again press Shift+Enter while on this line.\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 2\n\nTry clicking the play button again. What happens here? Can you explain why?\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 2\n\n An error will occur in the terminal. This is because VSCode tried to run the entire program again, but from inside an already open python program (which we opened when we ran a single line using the Shift+Enter method). To fix this, we can either exit() the current python execution in the current terminal, or Kill/Delete the open terminal. This button can be found by hovering over the Python symbol at the right hand side of the terminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom JupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an application with a web-based user interface that enables one to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and even custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.\nTo start JupyterLab, you can use Anaconda Navigator if you wish, however it is nearly always easier to access it from the command line. Inside VSCode, navigate to a new terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Reminder!\n\n\n\nMake sure that you double check that this new terminal is opened with the ds-env!\n\n\n\nhow to open, show you can run the notebooks in vscode too\ndo last and explain that we will be using notebooks throughout the course for the most part"

Take some time to set up a folder somewhere you won’t lose it. For me, I’ve simply made a folder called Intro to Python on my C: drive that will hold any course materials we use/create here.\nNext, to make any interactions with python, we will want to open VSCode and work from here. When we first open VSCode, you should be prompted to open a folder. We are going to work out of that Intro to Python folder, so open it here. After doing this, we should now have a VSCode screen open that will look something like this:\n\n\n\nVS Code\n\n\n\nWe have 3 main areas that we can utilize:\n\nTo the left (area A): is the current folder and subfolder directory list. We can make new files directly from here.\nTo the right (area B): this is where files we are working on will live. For some file types, preview windows will be available as well.\nTo the bottom (area C): this is where we can open and run commands from the command line (or terminal).\n\nNow remember, we set up a special environment that contains python and our data science packages. We want to make sure we are always using this environment, so in the open terminal, re-type conda activate ds-env and this terminal will now be open in this environment. We also want to check that VSCode itself (and not just the terminal) will use the same environment. We again access the command palette with Ctrl + Shift + P, and begin typing Python: Select Interpreter. Click on this, and choose the ds-env option. We are good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Environments\n\n\n\nAlthough it does add an extra level of set-up whenever we start a python project, having these conda environments ends up being incredibly important for not only reproducibility, but making sure that packages work well together. When in doubt as to if you are using the correct environment, double check that the terminal you are using has (ds-env) in brackets at the start of a line.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the command line/terminal\nLet’s start with an easy one. To start a python session from a terminal, simply type python at the command line, and the terminal will automatically open a python interface. You will know you are inside the python interface if your command lines now start with >>>. Now, let’s do the classic Hello World command for python:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n\nHello World!\n\n\nTo exit the python interface and return to the regular terminal, you can type exit() and return to the terminal.\n\n\nFrom a file (in VSCode)\nNext up, let’s run an entire python file to tell us hello. Inside our directory, create a new file called hello_world.py. Note that .py extension - this signifies that the content inside will be python code. Inside this file, let’s have two lines of code:\n\n\nhello_world.py\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nprint(\"Otters are the best animal.\")\n\nTo run this code, first save the file, and then simply click the play button (triangle in the top right!). Note that this will display an output in a terminal at the bottom of VSCode. VSCode takes the python file you told it to run, and will run every line of code individually. Thus, we get two lines of output for the two print statements.\nBut wait, there’s more! In VSCode we can run individual lines of code within a file as well. Simply move your cursor to the line you wish to run, and hit Shift+Enter.\nNote the difference here. Instead of running the entire file, VSCode actually opened up a python window inside our terminal, and ran the single line of code, just like we did before.\n\nChallenge 1\n\nRun the other line of code, and then add and run third line of code that prints your favourite TV show.\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 1\n\n hit Shift+Enter while the cursor is on the other line of code. Add a line of code such as:\nprint(\"C'mon son! You know the best show is Psych!\")\nSave the file, and again press Shift+Enter while on this line.\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 2\n\nTry clicking the play button again. What happens here? Can you explain why?\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 2\n\n An error will occur in the terminal. This is because VSCode tried to run the entire program again, but from inside an already open python program (which we opened when we ran a single line using the Shift+Enter method). To fix this, we can either exit() the current python execution in the current terminal, or Kill/Delete the open terminal. This button can be found by hovering over the Python symbol at the right hand side of the terminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom JupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an application with a web-based user interface that enables one to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and even custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.\nTo start JupyterLab, you can use Anaconda Navigator, a GUI that comes packaged with Anaconda if you wish. However it is nearly always easier to access it from the command line. Inside VSCode, navigate to a new terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Reminder!\n\n\n\nMake sure that you double check that this new terminal is opened with the ds-env!\n\n\nFrom the terminal, to launch a new JupyterLab session, simply type:\n\n\nterminal\n\n> jupyter lab\n\nThis should open up a screen that looks something like this:\n\n\n\nJupyterLab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nYou might have noticed by this point that the author of this section prefers dark mode. So if any of your programs are popping up in a different/lighter colour scheme, that’s okay!\n\n\nWe will be using the JupyterLab interface quite a bit, so let’s get used to the key pieces. Similar to VSCode, we have a few key areas to utilize:\n\nOn the left (area A), we have the sidebar that contains commonly used tabs. These include the file directory system (which defaults to the folder from which the session was launched), a list of open files, running kernels and terminals, a table of contents for any markdown that is written, and possibly a set of extensions.\nOn the right (area B), we have the main work area, where we can open new notebooks, terminals, files, etc. Here, when we have multiple open tabs, we can drag them around the main area to produce smaller panels displaying multiple pieces of work.\n\nGenerally speaking, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, which have a .ipynb file extension. Like python files, these notebooks can run python code. However, they also support markdown (text that can be added to support source code with explanations) as well as inline viewing of data tables, plots and more. This allows us to mix source code, text and images all in one file that we can quickly use for anything such as:\n\nAnswering ‘how did I get this number in that report?’\nLooking at the number.\nUpdating the number with an updated dataset.\nPlotting the number with other numbers, and then looking at all of those numbers.\n\nLet’s open up a notebook (click the Python 3 icon underneath the Notebook heading). This will open up a new tab called Untitled.ipynb.\n\nChallenge 3\n\nRename the notebook to hello_world.ipynb.\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 3\n\n On either the tab to the top, or the filename that popped up on the left panel, right click the file Untitled.ipynb and click Rename notebook.... Enter your new name here.\n\n\n\nIn this new file, we have a single blue box (this is a single cell). We can type multiple lines of code inside a single cell. Within the blue box, pressing Enter will let you add a new line to the cell. To execute a cell, we press Shift+Enter. This will execute every line of code within that cell. If there is output to display, it will display in the space directly below the cell. Pressing the + at the top of the tab will add a new cell (as will running the bottom-most cell). The ‘active’ cell will always be the one that is highlighted with a blue box.\n\n\nChallenge 4\n\nPrint ‘Hello World’ inside the Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 4\n\n Inside the blue box, write the python code:\nprint('Hello World!')\nWhile still on this cell (highlighted in blue), press Shift+Enter. We should see the output directly below! \n\n\nWhen we are done with a JupyterLab session, we must shutdown the server. From the Menu Bar select the File menu and then choose Shut Down at the bottom of the dropdown menu. You will be prompted to confirm that you wish to shutdown the JupyterLab server (don’t forget to save your work!). Click Shut Down to shutdown the JupyterLab server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyterLab and Us!\n\n\n\nWe will be using JupyterLab for the vast majority of our work throughout this course because of the ease of use in writing and executing code all in one place. Make sure you are comfortable with:\n\nopening JupyterLab to a specific folder\ncreating and renaming notebooks\nadding python code to multiple cells within a notebook\nexecuting entire code blocks\n\nIf you are unsure about any of these pieces, please ask for help!"
