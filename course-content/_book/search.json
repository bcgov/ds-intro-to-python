These include:\n\nFrom the command line\nInside a jupyter notebook\nFrom a file (inside VSCode)\n\nIn this next section, we are going to have a brief introduction to all of these methods of interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Using the command line\n\n\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that the methods that we will focus on in this course will rely on using VSCode and all of its inner workings. However, if you are comfortable with the command line, we can also access any of these methods directly from there as well, you just need to be able to move to directories before typing commands. If you use the command line, I recommend using an anaconda powershell prompt, as this allows for the easiest use and access to conda commands and only the smallest of headaches.\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Step 0\nIn all cases, we will want to have a folder from which we wish to work out of. Take some time to set up a folder somewhere you won’t lose it. For me, I’ve simply made a folder called Intro to Python on my C: drive that will hold any course materials we use/create here.\nNext, to make any interactions with python, we will want to open VSCode and work from here. When we first open VSCode, you should be prompted to open a folder. We are going to work out of that Intro to Python folder, so open it here. After doing this, we should now have a VSCode screen open that will look something like this:\n\n\n\nVS Code\n\n\n\nWe have 3 main areas that we can utilize:\n\nTo the left (area A): is the current folder and subfolder directory list. We can make new files directly from here.\nTo the right (area B): this is where files we are working on will live. For some file types, preview windows will be available as well.\nTo the bottom (area C): this is where we can open and run commands from the command line (or terminal).\n\nNow remember, we set up a special environment that contains python and our data science packages. We want to make sure we are always using this environment, so in the open terminal, re-type conda activate ds-env and this terminal will now be open in this environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Conda Environments\n\n\n\nAlthough it does add an extra level of set-up whenever we start a python project, having these conda environments ends up being incredibly important for not only reproducibility, but making sure that packages work well together. When in doubt as to if you are using the correct environment, double check that the terminal you are using has (ds-env) in brackets at the start of a line. When building python files directly in VSCode, there is another step we can take to make sure that the correct environment is being used, but we will get to that later…\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 From the command line/terminal\nLet’s start with an easy one. To start a python session from a terminal, simply type python at the command line, and the terminal will automatically open a python interface. You will know you are inside the python interface if your command lines now start with >>>. Now, let’s do the classic Hello World command for python:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n\nHello World!\n\n\nTo exit the python interface and return to the regular terminal, you can type exit() and return to the terminal.\n\n\n1.3.3 From a file (in VSCode)\n\nrun entire file, run single lines\n\nNext up, let’s run an entire python file to tell us hello.\n\n\n1.3.4 From a notebook\n\nhow to open, show you can run the notebooks in vscode too\ndo last and explain that we will be using notebooks throughout the course for the most part"

We again access the command pallette with Ctrl + Shift + P, and begin typing Python: Select Interpreter. Click on this, and choose the ds-env option. We are good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Environments\n\n\n\nAlthough it does add an extra level of set-up whenever we start a python project, having these conda environments ends up being incredibly important for not only reproducibility, but making sure that packages work well together.

When building python files directly in VSCode, there is another step we can take to make sure that the correct environment is being used, but we will get to that later…\n\n\n\n\nFrom the command line/terminal\nLet’s start with an easy one. To start a python session from a terminal, simply type python at the command line, and the terminal will automatically open a python interface. You will know you are inside the python interface if your command lines now start with >>>. Now, let’s do the classic Hello World command for python:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n\nHello World!\n\n\nTo exit the python interface and return to the regular terminal, you can type exit() and return to the terminal.\n\n\nFrom a file (in VSCode)\n\nrun entire file, run single lines\n\nNext up, let’s run an entire python file to tell us hello. Inside our directory, create a new file called hello_world.py. Inside this file, let’s have two lines of code:\n\n\nhello_world.py\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nprint(\"Otters are the best animal.\")\n\nTo run this code, first save the file, and then simply click the play button (triangle in the top right!). Note that this will display an output in a terminal at the bottom of VSCode. VSCode takes the python file you told it to run, and will run every line of code individually. Thus, we get two lines of output for the two print statements.\nBut wait, there’s more! In VSCode we can run individual lines of code within a file as well. Simply move your cursor to the line you wish to run, and hit Shift+Enter.\nNote the difference here. Instead of running the entire file, VSCode actually opened up a python window inside our terminal, and ran the single line of code, just like we did before.\n\nChallenge 1\n\nRun the other line of code, and then add and run third line of code that prints your favourite TV show.\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 1\n\n hit Shift+Enter while the cursor is on the other line of code. Add a line of code such as:\nprint(\"C'mon son! You know the best show is Psych!\")\nSave the file, and again press Shift+Enter while on this line.\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 2\n\nTry clicking the play button again. What happens here? Can you explain why?\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 2\n\n An error will occur in the terminal. This is because VSCode tried to run the entire program again, but from inside an already open python program (which we opened when we ran a single line using the Shift+Enter method). To fix this, we can either exit() the current python execution in the current terminal, or Kill/Delete the open terminal. This button can be found by hovering over the Python symbol at the right hand side of the terminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom JupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an application with a web-based user interface that enables one to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and even custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.\nTo start JupyterLab, you can use Anaconda Navigator if you wish, however it is nearly always easier to access it from the command line. Inside VSCode, navigate to a new terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Reminder!\n\n\n\nMake sure that you double check that this new terminal is opened with the ds-env!\n\n\n\nhow to open, show you can run the notebooks in vscode too\ndo last and explain that we will be using notebooks throughout the course for the most part"

Take some time to set up a folder somewhere you won’t lose it. For me, I’ve simply made a folder called Intro to Python on my C: drive that will hold any course materials we use/create here.\nNext, to make any interactions with python, we will want to open VSCode and work from here. When we first open VSCode, you should be prompted to open a folder. We are going to work out of that Intro to Python folder, so open it here. After doing this, we should now have a VSCode screen open that will look something like this:\n\n\n\nVS Code\n\n\n\nWe have 3 main areas that we can utilize:\n\nTo the left (area A): is the current folder and subfolder directory list. We can make new files directly from here.\nTo the right (area B): this is where files we are working on will live. For some file types, preview windows will be available as well.\nTo the bottom (area C): this is where we can open and run commands from the command line (or terminal).\n\nNow remember, we set up a special environment that contains python and our data science packages. We want to make sure we are always using this environment, so in the open terminal, re-type conda activate ds-env and this terminal will now be open in this environment. We also want to check that VSCode itself (and not just the terminal) will use the same environment. We again access the command palette with Ctrl + Shift + P, and begin typing Python: Select Interpreter. Click on this, and choose the ds-env option. We are good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Environments\n\n\n\nAlthough it does add an extra level of set-up whenever we start a python project, having these conda environments ends up being incredibly important for not only reproducibility, but making sure that packages work well together. When in doubt as to if you are using the correct environment, double check that the terminal you are using has (ds-env) in brackets at the start of a line.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the command line/terminal\nLet’s start with an easy one. To start a python session from a terminal, simply type python at the command line, and the terminal will automatically open a python interface. You will know you are inside the python interface if your command lines now start with >>>. Now, let’s do the classic Hello World command for python:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n\nHello World!\n\n\nTo exit the python interface and return to the regular terminal, you can type exit() and return to the terminal.\n\n\nFrom a file (in VSCode)\nNext up, let’s run an entire python file to tell us hello. Inside our directory, create a new file called hello_world.py. Note that .py extension - this signifies that the content inside will be python code. Inside this file, let’s have two lines of code:\n\n\nhello_world.py\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nprint(\"Otters are the best animal.\")\n\nTo run this code, first save the file, and then simply click the play button (triangle in the top right!). Note that this will display an output in a terminal at the bottom of VSCode. VSCode takes the python file you told it to run, and will run every line of code individually. Thus, we get two lines of output for the two print statements.\nBut wait, there’s more! In VSCode we can run individual lines of code within a file as well. Simply move your cursor to the line you wish to run, and hit Shift+Enter.\nNote the difference here. Instead of running the entire file, VSCode actually opened up a python window inside our terminal, and ran the single line of code, just like we did before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 1\n\n\n\nRun the other line of code, and then add and run a third line of code that prints your favourite TV show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 1\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Shift+Enter while the cursor is on the other line of code.\nAdd a line of code such as:\nprint(\"C'mon son! You know the best show is Psych!\")\nSave the file, and again press Shift+Enter while on this line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 2\n\n\n\nTry clicking the play button again. What happens here? Can you explain why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAn error will occur in the terminal.\nThis is because VSCode tried to run the entire program again, but from inside an already open python program (which we opened when we ran a single line using the Shift+Enter method).\nTo fix this, we can either exit() the current python execution in the current terminal, or Kill/Delete the open terminal. This button can be found by hovering over the Python symbol at the right hand side of the terminals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom JupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an application with a web-based user interface that enables one to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and even custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.\nTo start JupyterLab, you can use Anaconda Navigator, a GUI that comes packaged with Anaconda if you wish. However it is nearly always easier to access it from the command line. Inside VSCode, navigate to a new terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConda Reminder!\n\n\n\nMake sure that you double check that this new terminal is opened with the ds-env!\n\n\nFrom the terminal, to launch a new JupyterLab session, simply type:\n\n\nterminal\n\n> jupyter lab\n\nThis should open up a screen that looks something like this:\n\n\n\nJupyterLab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nYou might have noticed by this point that the author of this section prefers dark mode. So if any of your programs are popping up in a different/lighter colour scheme, that’s okay!\n\n\nWe will be using the JupyterLab interface quite a bit, so let’s get used to the key pieces. Similar to VSCode, we have a few key areas to utilize:\n\nOn the left (area A), we have the sidebar that contains commonly used tabs. These include the file directory system (which defaults to the folder from which the session was launched), a list of open files, running kernels and terminals, a table of contents for any markdown that is written, and possibly a set of extensions.\nOn the right (area B), we have the main work area, where we can open new notebooks, terminals, files, etc. Here, when we have multiple open tabs, we can drag them around the main area to produce smaller panels displaying multiple pieces of work.\n\nGenerally speaking, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, which have a .ipynb file extension. Like python files, these notebooks can run python code. However, they also support markdown (text that can be added to support source code with explanations) as well as inline viewing of data tables, plots and more. This allows us to mix source code, text and images all in one file that we can quickly use for anything such as:\n\nAnswering ‘how did I get this number in that report?’\nLooking at the number.\nUpdating the number with an updated dataset.\nPlotting the number with other numbers, and then looking at all of those numbers.\n\nLet’s open up a notebook (click the Python 3 icon underneath the Notebook heading). This will open up a new tab called Untitled.ipynb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 3\n\n\n\nRename the notebook to hello_world.ipynb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 3\n\n\n\n\n\nOn either the tab to the top, or the filename that popped up on the left panel, right click the file Untitled.ipynb and click Rename notebook.... Enter your new name here.\n\n\n\nIn this new file, we have a single blue box (this is a single cell). We can type multiple lines of code inside a single cell. Within the blue box, pressing Enter will let you add a new line to the cell. To execute a cell, we press Shift+Enter. This will execute every line of code within that cell. If there is output to display, it will display in the space directly below the cell. Pressing the + at the top of the tab will add a new cell (as will running the bottom-most cell). The ‘active’ cell will always be the one that is highlighted with a blue box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 4\n\n\n\nPrint ‘Hello World’ inside the Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 4\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the blue box, write the python code:\nprint('Hello World!')\nWhile still on this cell (highlighted in blue), press Shift+Enter. We should see the output directly below!\n\n\n\nWhen we are done with a JupyterLab session, we must shutdown the server. From the Menu Bar select the File menu and then choose Shut Down at the bottom of the dropdown menu. You will be prompted to confirm that you wish to shutdown the JupyterLab server (don’t forget to save your work!). Click Shut Down to shutdown the JupyterLab server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyterLab and Us!\n\n\n\nWe will be using JupyterLab for the vast majority of our work throughout this course because of the ease of use in writing and executing code all in one place. Make sure you are comfortable with:\n\nopening JupyterLab to a specific folder\ncreating and renaming notebooks\nadding python code to multiple cells within a notebook\nexecuting entire code blocks\n\nIf you are unsure about any of these pieces, please ask for help!"

    "text": "2.1 Variables & Assignment\nWe can assign values to variables in Python that we can use over and over. Variables are always assigned using the format:\n\nvariable_name = 'variable_value'\nfirst_name = 'Loki'\nage = 1054\n\nWhere the name of the variable is always to the left, and whatever value we wish to assign being on the right of =.\nSome rules regarding naming variables:\n\nNames may only contain letters, digits, and underscores\nAre case sensitive\nMust not start with a digit\n\nTypically, variables starting with _ or __ have special meaning, so we will try to stick to starting variables with letters only\n\n\nTo display the value we have previously assigned to a variable, we can use the print function:\n\nprint(first_name, 'is', age, 'Earth years old.')\n\nLoki is 1054 Earth years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 1\n\n\n\nIn the next cell, run the following command:\nprint(last_name)\nWhat happens? Why? How can we fix it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 1\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables cannot be referenced before they are assigned, so we will run into an error:\n\nprint(last_name)\n\nNameError: name 'last_name' is not defined\n\n\nTo fix this, we simply need to create another cell that assigns this variable, then we can go back and run the print command.\n\nlast_name = 'Odinson'\n\n\nprint(last_name)\n\nOdinson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 2\n\n\n\nFill the table below showing the values of the variables in this program after each statement is executed.\n\n\n\nCommand\nValue of x\nValue of y\nValue of swap\n\n\n\n\nx = 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\ny = 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\nswap = x\n\n\n\n\n\nx = y\n\n\n\n\n\ny = swap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nValue of x\nValue of y\nValue of swap\n\n\n\n\nx = 1.0\n1.0\nnot defined\nnot defined\n\n\ny = 3.0\n1.0\n3.0\nnot defined\n\n\nswap = x\n1.0\n3.0\n1.0\n\n\nx = y\n3.0\n3.0\n1.0\n\n\ny = swap\n3.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks: Order of Execution\n\n\n\nIf you noticed in the last challenge, you could go back to a previous cell above where you assigned a variable, and the print command would work. This is because, in a Jupyter notebook, it is the order of execution of cells that is important, not the order in which they appear. Python will remember all the code that was run previously, including any variables you have defined, irrespective of cell order.\nAfter a long day of work and to prevent confusion, it can be helpful to use the Kernel → Restart & Run All option which clears the interpreter and runs everything from a clean slate going top to bottom."

    "text": "2.3 Data Types\nEvery value in a program has a specific type. In this course, you will run across four basic types in Python:\n\nInteger (int): positive or negative whole numbers like 42 or 90210\nFloating point numbers (float): real fractional numbers like 3.14159 or -87.6\nCharacter strings (str): text written either in single or double quotes.\nBoolean (bool): the logical values of True and False\n\nIf you are unsure what type anything is, we can use the built in function type. Note that this works on variables as well.\n\nprint(type(42))\nprint(type(3.14))\nprint(type('Otter'))\nprint(type(True))\n\n<class 'int'>\n<class 'float'>\n<class 'str'>\n<class 'bool'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessy Numbers\n\n\n\nWhen you start to have really long integers, it starts to look really messy (how many thousands are in 1982137092 at a glance?) Luckily, Python allows us to use _ inside our integers to space out our digits. Thus we could write that instead as 1_902_137_092. Isn’t that nicer!\n\n\n\nBasic Arithmetic\nThe type of a variable controls what operations can be performed on it. For example, we can subtract floats and ints, but we cannot subtract strings:\n\nprint(42-12)\nprint(3.14-15)\nprint('hello' - 'h')\n\n30\n-11.86\n\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n\n\nHowever, we can add strings together:\n\nmy_sentence = 'Adding' + ' ' + 'strings' + ' ' + 'concatenates them.'\nprint(my_sentence)\n\nAdding strings concatenates them.\n\n\nAs well as multipling a string by an integer to get a repeated string:\n\nrepeated_string = '=+'*10\nprint(repeated_string)\n\n=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\n\nAs we saw above, we can mix and match both of the numerical types, however we will get an error if we try to mix a string with a number:\n\nprint(1 + '2')\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n\n\nIn order to have a sensical operation, we need to convert variables to a common type before doing our operation. We can convert variables using the type name as a function.\n\nprint(1 + int('2'))\nprint(str(1) + '2')\n\n3\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInt of a Float?\n\n\n\nNote that when converting floats to integers, it will always round down! That is, int(3.6) = int(3.1) = 3!\n\n\nOne last bit of math you might come across are the various types of division:\n\n/ performs regular floating-point division\n// performs integer floor division\n% returns the remainder of integer division\n\n\nprint('5 / 3 :', 5 / 3)\nprint('5 // 3:', 5 // 3)\nprint('5 % 3 :', 5 % 3)\n\n5 / 3 : 1.6666666666666667\n5 // 3: 1\n5 % 3 : 2\n\n\n\n\nBuilt in Functions\nPython has multiple pre-built functions that come in handy. We have already made use of the print() command frequently, and learned how to use type() to tell us what type of data our variables are. Here are some other frequently used functions:\n\nlen() : Tells us the length of a list, string, or other ordered object. Does not work on numbers!\nhelp() : Gives help for other functions\nmin() : Gives the mininum value in a list of options.\nmax() : Gives the maximum value in a list of options.\nround(): Rounds a value to a given decimal length.\n\nNote that, similar to the arithmetic operations above, these built in functions must operate on logically consistent datatypes. We can find the min of 2 strings, or 4 numbers, but we cannot compare a string to a float.\nEvery function in python will take 0 or more arguments that are passed to a function. For example, len() takes exactly one argument, and returns the length of that argument:\n\n print(len('this string is how long?'))\n\n24\n\n\nSome functions, such as min() and max() take a variable number of arguments:\n\n print(min(1,2,3,4))\n print(max('a', 'b', 'c'))\n\n1\nc\n\n\nWhile others have default values that do not need to be provided at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 4\n\n\n\nUse the help() and round() functions to print out the value of 2.71828182845904523536 to 0 and 2 decimal places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result of help() tells us that round() has a default option:\n\nhelp(round)\n\nHelp on built-in function round in module builtins:\n\nround(number, ndigits=None)\n    Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.\n    \n    The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.  Otherwise\n    the return value has the same type as the number.  ndigits may be negative.\n\n\n\nThus, we can use the round() function with and without the default ndigits to get our answer:\n\neulers_number = 2.71828182845904523536\nprint(round(eulers_number))\nprint(round(eulers_number, 2))\n\n3\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp in Jupyter Lab!\n\n\n\nIn Jupyter notebooks, we can also get help by starting a line with ?. For example, ?round will display the help information about the round() function.\n\n\n\n\nA Quick Intro to Boolean Logic"

    "section": "2.4 Methods & Chaining",
    "text": "2.4 Methods & Chaining\n\n\n\nObject Oriented Programming\n\n\nSo far we have seen built in functions that can be applied to a variety of different datatypes (as long as the datatype makes sense for that particular function). However, there are some functions that we apply specifically to a particular class of objects - we call these functions methods. Methods have parentheses, just like functions, but they come after the variable to denote that the method belongs to this particular object.\nWe have met classes already: all of our basic datatypes (strings, integers, floats, booleans) are different classes of objects in Python. An individual instance of a class is considered an object of that class. Understanding how to use methods will become useful when we reach the pandas portion of the course, which is our main tool when looking at, cleaning, and summarizing data.\nLet’s consider the string class. Here are a few common methods associated with it:\n\nlower(): coverts all characters in the string to lowercase\nupper(): converts all characters in the string to uppercase\nindex(): returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string\nrjust(): right aligns the string according to the width specified\nisnumeric(): returns True if all characters are numeric\nreplace(): replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help For Methods\n\n\n\nYou will notice that trying to find help on a method will not work if you only specify the method. Because these are not built in functions, and only belong to instances of a class, you need to specify the object together with the method to use help.\nFor example, help(lower) will result in an error, whereas help(\"any string\".lower) will give you the help you were looking for.\n\n\nLet’s see some of these in action. You’ll notice that when being used, methods don’t always have an argument supplied to them. That is because the first argument is always the object is being applied to. If a method requires secondary arguments, these are subsequently included in the parentheses.\n\nobject.method(a, b, c, ...) ↔︎ method(object, a, b, c, ...)\n\n\nmy_string = 'Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers'\nprint(my_string.lower())\nprint(my_string.isnumeric())\n\npeter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers\nFalse\n\n\nWe can also chain methods together. Each subsequent method (reading from left to right) acts on the output of the previous method. Chaining can be done in a single line, or over multiple lines (which helps for readability).\n\nprint(my_string.upper().replace('P', 'M'))\n\n# Chaining over multiple lines can be done in 2 ways:\n# 1. Enclose the entire operation in brackets\nchain_1 = (my_string\n    .upper()\n    .replace('P', 'M')\n)\n\n# 2. Use the character \"\\\" to denote an operation is continuing on the next line\nchain_2 = my_string \\\n    .upper() \\\n    .replace('P', 'M')\n\nprint(chain_1)\nprint(chain_2)\n\nMETER MIMER MICKED A MECK OF MICKLED MEMMERS\nMETER MIMER MICKED A MECK OF MICKLED MEMMERS\nMETER MIMER MICKED A MECK OF MICKLED MEMMERS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 6\n\n\n\nWhat happens if we try to run the block of code:\nprint(my_string.isnumeric().upper())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 6\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will get an error:\n\nprint(my_string.isnumeric().upper())\n\nAttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'upper'\n\n\nThis is because the code is read from left to right. In this case, the output of isnumeric() is a boolean object, which does not have the method upper() anymore:\n\nprint(my_string.isnumeric())\nprint(type(my_string.isnumeric()))\n\nFalse\n<class 'bool'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 7\n\n\n\nA common data string you see across government are various personal IDs. One example is the Personal Education Number (PEN), which is a nine-digit number assigned to you when you enter the K-12 School System. Oftentimes when looking at such an ID, any leading zeros that are an actual part of the PEN get stripped away, leading to unevenly sized strings of IDs across the dataset.\nWrite a piece of code for PEN IDs that does the following:\n\nChecks to make sure that the ID is entirely numeric. If it is not, print out a warning that this is an invalid PEN.\nIf the PEN is numeric, make sure that it is less than or equal to 9 digits long. If it is longer, print out a warning that this is an invalid PEN.\nIf the PEN is too short, make sure to pad it with the appropriate number of 0’s to the left. Print out the correct PEN.\n\nTry your code out with the following PENs:\npen_1 = '12345678x'\npen_2 = '123456789'\npen_3 = '1234567890'\npen_4 = 123456789\npen_5 = '123456'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\npen_1 = '123456'\n\n# first! make sure we are looking at strings so we can use the string method!\npen = str(pen_1)\n\n# first check for numerical:\nif not pen.isnumeric():\n    print('Warning! This PEN has non-numeric characters.')\n\n# second, check that it isn't too long\nelif len(pen)>9:\n    print('Warning! This PEN is longer than 9 digits.')\n\n# third: make sure that we pad it to the correct length\nelse:\n    pen = pen.rjust(9, '0')\n    print('This PEN is valid:', pen)\n\nThis PEN is valid: 000123456"

    "section": "2.5 Accessing Other Packages",
    "text": "2.5 Accessing Other Packages\n\n\n\nImport Packages\n\n\nMost of the power of Python lies in its ability to use libraries, or external packages that are not part of the base Python programming language. These libraries have been written and maintained by other members of the Python community, and will make data cleaning, manipulation, visualization and any other data project much simpler. Throughout this course we will use packages such as:\n\npandas: this is the go-to package for all things data-table.\nmatplotlib: this is the most frequently used plotting package in Python\nseaborn: this is a plotting package built with pandas and data in mind\n\nWhen we set up our Python environment, we already installed many of the packages we will need directly into the conda environment we produced. If you ever need another package, it is simple enough to install again using conda:\n\n\nAnaconda Powershell Prompt\n\n> conda activate ds-env\n> conda install <package>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Pip or not to Pip?\n\n\n\nIf you are ever searching for a package you think will aid you in your work, you might come across the pip command. This is a different (yet related) method of installing packages. While it is possible to use pip in tandem with conda commands, it is recommended that you stick to only conda wherever possible.\nAs a rule of thumb, try to conda install package as a first try. If this does not work, search the website for the package for installation instructions. Sometimes it will recommend using a different conda channel (and will provide the code to do so). Sometimes, it is only possible to get the package from pip, in which case using pip inside the conda environment is the only way to go. Just use this as a last resort!\n\n\nOkay great, we have all these awesome libraries that have been built out by others. How do we actually use them? In Python, it is actually fairly simple!\nOption 1: Use import to load an entire library module into a program’s memory. Refer to things from the module as module_name.thing_name\n\n import math\n\n print('pi is', math.pi)\n print('cos(pi) is', math.cos(math.pi))\n\npi is 3.141592653589793\ncos(pi) is -1.0\n\n\nOption 2: If we only need a specific function or tool from the library, use from module import thing\n\nfrom math import cos, pi\n\nprint('cos(pi) is', cos(pi))\n\ncos(pi) is -1.0\n\n\nOption 3: If we really do need the entire library, but we do not want to type the entire long name over and over, create an alias\n\nimport math as m\n\nprint('cos(pi) is', m.cos(m.pi))\n\ncos(pi) is -1.0\n\n\nSome common alias for common libraries include:\n\npandas → pd\nmatplotlib.pyplot → plt\nseaborn → sns\nnumpy → np"

    "section": "2.2 Lists & Indexing",
    "text": "2.2 Lists & Indexing\n\n\n\nSorry not sorry R\n\n\nAn important aspect of Pythonic programming is the use of indicies to allow us to slice and dice our datasets. We will learn a bit more about indexing here through the introduction of lists. A list is an ordered list of items in Python, where the items can take on any datatype (even another list!). We create a list by putting values inside square brackets and separate items with commas:\n\nmy_list = [1, 'two', 3.0, True]\nprint(my_list)\n\n[1, 'two', 3.0, True]\n\n\nTo access the elements of a list we use indices, the numbered positions of elements in the list. These positions are numbered starting at 0, so the first element has an index of 0. Python has made it easy to count backwards as well: the last index can be accessed using index -1, the second last with -2 and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0-Based Indexing!\n\n\n\nIf you have used other coding languages, such as R, you may notice that different programming languages start counting from different numbers. In R, you start your indexing from 1, but in Python it is 0. It’s important to keep this in mind!\n\n\n\nprint('First element:', my_list[0])\nprint('Last element:', my_list[-1])\nprint('Second last element:', my_list[2])\nprint('Also second last element:', my_list[-2])\n\nFirst element: 1\nLast element: True\nSecond last element: 3.0\nAlso second last element: 3.0\n\n\nStrings also have indices, pointing to the character in each string. These work in the same way as lists.\n\nprint(first_name)\nprint(first_name[0])\n\nLoki\nL\n\n\nHowever, there is one important difference between lists and strings: we can change values in a list, but we cannot change individual characters in a string. For example:\n\nprint(my_list)\nmy_list[0] = 'changing the first element!'\nprint(my_list)\n\n[1, 'two', 3.0, True]\n['changing the first element!', 'two', 3.0, True]\n\n\nwill work. However:\n\nprint(first_name)\nfirst_name[0] = 'N'\n\nLoki\n\n\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n\n\nWill throw an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutable vs Immutable\n\n\n\nData which can be modified in place is called mutable, while data which cannot be modified is called immutable. Strings and numbers are immutable. This does not mean that variables with string or number values are constants, but when we want to change the value of a string or number variable, we can only replace the old value with a completely new value.\nLists and arrays, on the other hand, are mutable: we can modify them after they have been created. We can change individual elements, append new elements, or reorder the whole list. For some operations, like sorting, we can choose whether to use a function that modifies the data in-place or a function that returns a modified copy and leaves the original unchanged.\nBe careful when modifying data in-place. If two variables refer to the same list, and you modify the list value, it will change for both variables!\n\n\nWe can use indicies for more than just accessing single elements from an ordered object such as a list or a string. We can also slice our dataset to give us different portions of the list. We do this using the slice notation [start:stop], where start is the integer index of the first element we want and stop is the integer index of the element just after the last element we want. If either of start or stop is left out, it is assumed that you want to default with either starting from the beginning of the list or ending at the end.\n\nnumber_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nprint('0:5  --> ', number_list[0:5])\nprint('_:5  --> ', number_list[:5])\nprint('3:7  --> ', number_list[3:5])\nprint('3:_  --> ', number_list[3:])\nprint('3:-1 --> ', number_list[3:-1])\n\n0:5  -->  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n_:5  -->  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n3:7  -->  [3, 4]\n3:_  -->  [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n3:-1 -->  [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n\nWe can also use a step-size to indicate how often we want to pick up an element of the list. By altering the slice notation to [start:stop:step] we will be telling the code to only include those elements at each step after start, ending at the final step that occurs just before running into stop. This allows us to reverse lists as well:\n\nprint('All evens:', number_list[0::2])\nprint('All odds: ', number_list[1::2])\nprint('Just 1 and 4:', number_list[1:5:3])\nprint('Reversed: ', number_list[-1::-1])\n\nAll evens: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\nAll odds:  [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nJust 1 and 4: [1, 4]\nReversed:  [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 3\n\n\n\nGiven the following string:\n\nfull_name = 'Peregrin Fool of a Took Pippin'\n\nWhat would these expressions return?\n\nfull_name[2:8]\nfull_name[11:] (without a value after the colon)\nfull_name[:4] (without a value before the colon)\nfull_name[:] (just a colon)\nfull_name[11:-3]\nfull_name[-5:-3]\nWhat happens when you choose a stop value which is out of range? (i.e., try full_name[0:42] or full_name[:103])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'regrin '\n'ol of a Took Pippin'\n'Pere'\n'Peregrin Fool of a Took Pippin'\n'ol of a Took Pip'\n'ip'\nIf a part of the slice is out of range, the operation does not fail. full_name[:] gives the same result as full_name[0:42], and the same result as full_name[:103]."

    "section": "2.3 Data Types & Operations",
    "text": "2.3 Data Types & Operations\nEvery value in a program has a specific type. In this course, you will run across four basic types in Python:\n\nInteger (int): positive or negative whole numbers like 42 or 90210\nFloating point numbers (float): real fractional numbers like 3.14159 or -87.6\nCharacter strings (str): text written either in single or double quotes.\nBoolean (bool): the logical values of True and False\n\nIf you are unsure what type anything is, we can use the built in function type. Note that this works on variables as well.\n\nprint(type(42))\nprint(type(3.14))\nprint(type('Otter'))\nprint(type(True))\n\n<class 'int'>\n<class 'float'>\n<class 'str'>\n<class 'bool'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessy Numbers\n\n\n\nWhen you start to have really long integers, it starts to look really messy (how many thousands are in 1982137092 at a glance?) Luckily, Python allows us to use _ inside our integers to space out our digits. Thus we could write that instead as 1_902_137_092. Isn’t that nicer!\n\n\n\nBasic Arithmetic\nThe type of a variable controls what operations can be performed on it. For example, we can subtract floats and ints, but we cannot subtract strings:\n\nprint(42-12)\nprint(3.14-15)\nprint('hello' - 'h')\n\n30\n-11.86\n\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n\n\nHowever, we can add strings together:\n\nmy_sentence = 'Adding' + ' ' + 'strings' + ' ' + 'concatenates them.'\nprint(my_sentence)\n\nAdding strings concatenates them.\n\n\nAs well as multipling a string by an integer to get a repeated string:\n\nrepeated_string = '=+'*10\nprint(repeated_string)\n\n=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\n\nAs we saw above, we can mix and match both of the numerical types, however we will get an error if we try to mix a string with a number:\n\nprint(1 + '2')\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n\n\nIn order to have a sensical operation, we need to convert variables to a common type before doing our operation. We can convert variables using the type name as a function.\n\nprint(1 + int('2'))\nprint(str(1) + '2')\n\n3\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInt of a Float?\n\n\n\nNote that when converting floats to integers, it will always round down! That is, int(3.6) = int(3.1) = 3!\n\n\nOne last bit of math you might come across are the various types of division:\n\n/ performs regular floating-point division\n// performs integer floor division\n% returns the remainder of integer division\n\n\nprint('5 / 3 :', 5 / 3)\nprint('5 // 3:', 5 // 3)\nprint('5 % 3 :', 5 % 3)\n\n5 / 3 : 1.6666666666666667\n5 // 3: 1\n5 % 3 : 2\n\n\n\n\nBuilt in Functions\nPython has multiple pre-built functions that come in handy. We have already made use of the print() command frequently, and learned how to use type() to tell us what type of data our variables are. Here are some other frequently used functions:\n\nlen() : Tells us the length of a list, string, or other ordered object. Does not work on numbers!\nhelp() : Gives help for other functions\nmin() : Gives the mininum value in a list of options.\nmax() : Gives the maximum value in a list of options.\nround(): Rounds a value to a given decimal length.\n\nNote that, similar to the arithmetic operations above, these built in functions must operate on logically consistent datatypes. We can find the min of 2 strings, or 4 numbers, but we cannot compare a string to a float.\nEvery function in python will take 0 or more arguments that are passed to a function. For example, len() takes exactly one argument, and returns the length of that argument:\n\n print(len('this string is how long?'))\n\n24\n\n\nSome functions, such as min() and max() take a variable number of arguments:\n\n print(min(1,2,3,4))\n print(max('a', 'b', 'c'))\n\n1\nc\n\n\nWhile others have default values that do not need to be provided at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 4\n\n\n\nUse the help() and round() functions to print out the value of 2.71828182845904523536 to 0 and 2 decimal places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result of help() tells us that round() has a default option:\n\nhelp(round)\n\nHelp on built-in function round in module builtins:\n\nround(number, ndigits=None)\n    Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.\n    \n    The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.  Otherwise\n    the return value has the same type as the number.  ndigits may be negative.\n\n\n\nThus, we can use the round() function with and without the default ndigits to get our answer:\n\neulers_number = 2.71828182845904523536\nprint(round(eulers_number))\nprint(round(eulers_number, 2))\n\n3\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp in Jupyter Lab!\n\n\n\nIn Jupyter notebooks, we can also get help by starting a line with ?. For example, ?round will display the help information about the round() function.\n\n\n\n\nA Quick Intro to Boolean Logic\nWe can ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, with the if statement:\n\nnum = 37\nif num > 100:\n    print('greater')\nelse:\n    print('not greater')\nprint('done')\n\nnot greater\ndone\n\n\nThe if keyword tells Python we want to make a choice. We then use : to end the conditional we would like to consider, and indentation to specify our if block of code that should execute if the condition is met. If the condition is not met, the body of the else block gets executed instead.\nIn either case, ‘done’ will always print as it is in neither indented block.\n\n\n\nFollowing a Logical Flow\n\n\nConditional statements do not need to include an else block. If there is no block and the condition is False, Python simply does nothing:\n\nnum = 37\nif num > 100:\n    print('greater')\nprint('done')\n\ndone\n\n\nWe can also chain several tests together using elif. Python will go through the code line by line, looking for a condition that is met. If no condition is met, it will execute the else block (or nothing if there is no else).\n\nnum = 45\nif num < 42:\n    print('This is not the answer.')\nelif num > 42:\n    print('This is also not the answer.')\nelse:\n    print('This is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.')\n\nThis is also not the answer.\n\n\nThere are multiple different comparisons we can make in Python:\n\n>: greater than\n<: less than\n==: equal to (note the double ‘=’ here!)\n!=: does not equal\n>=: greater than or equal to\n<=: less than or equal to\n\nAnd these can be used in conjunction with each other using the special keywords and, or, and not. and will evaluate to True if both parts are True, while or will evaluate to True if either side is. not will evaluate the condition, and then return the opposite result.\n\ncondition_1 =  1 > 0  # True\ncondition_2 = -1 > 0  # False\n\nprint('Testing and: ')\nif condition_1 and condition_2:\n    print('both parts are true')\nelse:\n    print('at least one part is false')\n\nprint()\nprint('Testing or: ')\nif condition_1 or condition_2:\n    print('at least one part is true')\nelse:\n    print('both parts are false')\n\nprint()\nprint('Testing not: ')\nif not condition_1:\n    print('condition_1 was false')\nelse:\n    print('condition_1 was true')\n\nTesting and: \nat least one part is false\n\nTesting or: \nat least one part is true\n\nTesting not: \ncondition_1 was true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMultiple Conditions Cause Confusion\nJust like with arithmetic, you can and should use parentheses whenever there is possible ambiguity. A good general rule is to always use parentheses when mixing and and or in the same condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 5\n\n\n\nWhat will be the output of the following block of code?\nnum = 42 \nanimal = 'otter'\n\nif num==42 and animal=='mouse':\n    print('Correct, that is the animal that found the answer')\nelif num==42 and animal!='mouse':\n    print('Almost, the number is correct but not the animal.')\n    animal = 'dolphin'\nelif num!=42 or animal=='mouse':\n    print('Almost, the animal is correct but not the number.')\n    num = 5\nelif (1>3) or (4>3):\n    print('This has nothing to do with it, we just needed an or statement')\nelse:\n    print('Not even close, those pesky mice need to work harder.')\n    num = 19\n    animal = 'kangaroo'\n\nprint('The end result is the number', number, 'and animal', animal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Challenge 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost, the number is correct but not the animal.\nThe end result is the number 42 and animal dolphin"
