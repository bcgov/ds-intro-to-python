    "Most data projects consist of some version of a) finding some data, b) cleaning it up, and c) generating some insights. In an Excel world, all three stages often happen in a single document. Usually over many tabs. Almost always with little documentation. If the project is purely \"ask a one time question and get a one time answer and literally never need to look at the file again\", then this approach is arguably efficient and effective. But what if we want to update the insights over time or apply the question to a different dataset? What if someone wants to reproduce what we did?  How about verify if what we did was valid? Then we have to admit a complex Excel workbook is neither efficient nor effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a strategy ahead of time about how you organize your work when you are starting a project will pay handsome dividends, both for you and for anyone who will be accessing your work down the road. And when you use code (e.g. R or Python) to do a lot of the processing of the data in your project, it is unavoidable that you will have to make some decisions about how to manage your work, which includes managing your files.    \n",

We should be able to make the same cake over and over again with a stocked pantry and access to the recipe. But if we lose either the stocked pantry or the recipe, we won't be able to make the cake.
