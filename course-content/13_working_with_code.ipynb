    "Most data projects consist of some version of a) finding some data, b) cleaning it up, and c) generating some insights. In an Excel world, all three stages often happen in a single document. Usually over many tabs. Almost always with little documentation. If the project is purely \"ask a one time question and get a one time answer and literally never need to look at the file again\", then this approach is arguably efficient and effective. But what if we want to update the insights over time or apply the question to a different dataset? What if someone wants to reproduce what we did?  How about verify if what we did was valid? Then we have to admit a complex Excel workbook is neither efficient nor effective. \n",

And when you use code (e.g. R or Python) to do a lot of the processing of the data in your project, it is unavoidable that you will have to make some decisions about how to manage your work, which includes managing your files.    \n",

    "All of the rules above are about coding the \"right\" or \"correct\" way. There are times when you can consider breaking, or at least bending some of the rules for the greater good of being \"consistent\". This is especially the case when you are working on code as part of a project. Sometimes it is better to be consistent than right. This is often true if you are working on code as part of another project with some unique style practices. Keeping internally consistent with these practices will lead to overall greater readability, which is the greater goal of coding style. "
