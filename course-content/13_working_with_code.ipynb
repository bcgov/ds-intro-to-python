        "Most data projects consist of some version of a) finding some data, b) cleaning it up, and c) generating some insights. In an Excel world, all three stages often happen in a single document. Often over many tabs. Almost always with little documentation. If the project is purely \"ask a one time question and get a one time answer and literally never need to look at the file again\", then this approach is arguably efficient and effective. But what if we want to update the insights over time or apply the question to a different dataset? What if someone wants to reproduce what we did?  How about verify if what we did was valid or fix something that has gone wrong? These are some of the reasons why good file management practice is key to data project success. \n",
