# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a repository to house materials for a 2 day course introducing participants to data science using Python.

The goal of this workshop is to teach new-to-programming data professionals to import data, clean up and summarize a data set, and make some static data visualizations using Python. This is an introductory course to programming, specifically programming with Python. Python is a popular computer language for statistics and other scientific disciplines. It is commonly used for statistical analysis, machine-learning, generating high quality visualzations, and automating data workflows. 

The workshop content will follow best practices for Python for data analysis, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of Python and scientific computing.

## Who should take this course?

 * Anyone who works with data or who is interested in learning efficient ways to make meaning from data
 * Anyone keen to learn a programming language (**no prior experience necessary!**)

#### Pre-Course Work

:::{.callout-important}
## Important!

Before the course starts, we ask that all attendees install Python and its associated packages required for data analysis! Instructions for how to do so are found on the [next page](00_introduction_to_python.qmd#before-starting). If anyone is having troubles getting Python up and running, please contact us **before** the course starts so that we can hit the ground running during the workshop.
